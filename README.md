# Portfolio-of-Md.-Azim
This is Md. Azim. 
I am an academic professional with a strong background in accounting and business education. He earned his MPhil degree in 2024 from the Department of Accounting and Information Systems, University of Dhaka. His research, titled “Predicting Corporate Failure: A Study on Selected Bangladeshi Companies,” reflects his keen interest in financial risk analysis and corporate sustainability. He also holds an MBA in Accounting and Information Systems from Jagannath University, Dhaka, completed in 2010 (degree conferred in 2012).

Presently, my research interests focus on business sustainability issues, with a particular emphasis on pursuing a PhD degree in Business Sustainability. The proposed study aims to examine the influence of government and institutional (internal) ESG policies on ethical practices related to the environment, stakeholders, and governance within organizations. It also seeks to analyze how ethical practices toward the environment (E), stakeholders (S), and governance (G) affect organizational profitability, and to explore the role of profitability as a driver of long-term business sustainability. Beyond this, my broader research interests encompass ethical practices for sustainable business development, prevention of corporate failure, business management, and financial management for ensuring sustainability and corporate profitability.
To date, I have published fourteen (14) research articles in renowned national and international peer-reviewed journals, along with one conference paper. To strengthen my research capabilities, I have completed various professional training programs, including Research Methodology, Quantitative Analysis, and the use of analytical software such as SPSS, AMOS, STATA, and SmartPLS.

I am currently serving as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Business Administration at World University of Bangladesh (WUB), Dhanmondi, Dhaka, a position he has held since February 2022. Prior to this, he served as Senior Lecturer from March 2018 to January 2022, and Lecturer from March 2014 to February 2018. Since June 2019, he has also taken on the role of Coordinator of the BBA Program in the same department.

Earlier in his career, he gained practical exposure to the banking sector through an internship at Bangladesh Development Bank Ltd. (BDBL), Motijheel, Dhaka, from October to December 2012. He also served as a Lecturer in the BBA in Aviation Management program at Newport Institute of Technology, Uttara, Dhaka, from June to October 2013.

My teaching philosophy focuses on nurturing young generations who represent the future leaders of society. I firmly believe that with proper motivation and guidance, the latent talents within each student can be cultivated, fostering a lifelong passion for learning.

To become an effective educator, I maintain a strong commitment to continuous learning and research. I actively integrate research findings into the academic curriculum to enhance the quality of education and enrich the learning experience of my students.

My approach to teaching extends beyond the transmission of knowledge; I strive to instill essential skills, attitudes, and values that enable students to become competent and responsible graduates, capable of contributing meaningfully to both national and global development. To achieve this, I employ Bloom’s Taxonomy and outcome-based education frameworks to ensure that each graduate attains the desired learning outcomes.

I believe that inspiring students to pursue knowledge and skill development transforms them into valuable national assets. Furthermore, I advocate for blended learning approaches, as they offer enhanced opportunities for student engagement and achievement. In this regard, I utilize platforms such as Google Classroom and Moodle to provide instructional materials and support learning beyond traditional classroom settings.
